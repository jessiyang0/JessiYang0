## 📝 About Me

📘 I specialize in **AI/ML model development, edge computing, and full-stack engineering**.  
📕 At TSMC, I deployed **INT8 TensorRT-optimized ViT/YOLO models** on Jetson Xavier, reducing wafer defect detection latency to ~35ms.  
📙 My master's research includes **GPU kernel trace analysis**, NaN injection debugging, and building a retrieval-augmented agent for PyTorch kernel anomaly detection.  
📔 My academic projects cover **time-series forecasting** (ProbSparse Attention), **LangChain RAG pipelines**, and **interactive data visualization** for decision-making.  
🌱 Always learning **MLOps**, **Cloud Deployment**, and **Edge AI Optimization**.
